    "# Introduction to RNA and Protein Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter on [DNA and Transcription](https://github.com/rebelford/DataChem2025Book/blob/main/content/appendices/MBP2_Genes.ipynb), we explored how DNA serves as the master template for life and how its genetic information is copied into RNA through the process of transcription. In this next step of gene expression, we turn our attention to translation, the process by which the sequence of nucleotides in RNA is converted into a sequence of amino acids that form a protein. This process is universal across all life forms and lies at the heart of biology: proteins are the workhorses of the cell, catalyzing biochemical reactions, transmitting signals, and providing structural integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule reaches the cytoplasm, it serves as a blueprint for protein construction. The ribosome reads the mRNA three nucleotides at a time; each triplet, called a codon, specifies a particular amino acid. Specialized adaptor molecules called transfer RNAs (tRNAs) act as translators between the language of nucleotides and the language of amino acids. Each tRNA carries one amino acid and contains an anticodon that pairs precisely with a complementary codon on the mRNA strand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein assembly takes place on a ribosome, a large molecular complex made of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, it links amino acids together by forming peptide bonds in the exact order dictated by the genetic code. Translation proceeds in three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting chain of amino acids, known as a polypeptide, is not yet functional. It must fold into a specific three-dimensional shape to become an active protein. Some proteins fold spontaneously, while others require the help of chaperone proteins. Many also undergo post-translational modifications—such as cleavage, phosphorylation, or glycosylation—that fine-tune their activity, stability, and cellular destination.\n"

    "# 1. Codons and Amino Acids\n",
    "\n",
    "The ribosome reads the messenger RNA (mRNA) three nucleotides at a time. Each three-base sequence, called a codon, specifies one amino acid to be added to the growing polypeptide chain. Because RNA uses four bases—adenine (A), uracil (U), cytosine (C), and guanine (G)—the number of possible codons is:\n",

The codon AUG serves as the start codon, signaling both the beginning of a protein and the amino acid methionine.\n",

This flexibility allows a single tRNA to recognize several codons that differ only at that final base, explaining much of the redundancy (degeneracy) of the genetic code. In most cases, variation occurs at the third base, but a few amino acids—such as leucine, serine, and arginine—show differences in other positions as well.\n",

Ultimately, the precise arrangement of these forces dictates a protein’s shape, and its shape determines its function—whether as an enzyme, receptor, transporter, or structural element of the cell."

    "## Activity: Amino Acid Chemistry with RDKit and SMARTS\n",
    "\n",
    "The following activity builds on your earlier SMARTS primer. Here, you’ll use RDKit to visualize amino acids and identify functional groups in each structure using SMARTS pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses the SMARTS dictionary from the earlier activity to detect common functional groups,\n",
    "* Classifies amino acids as hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or charged, and\n",
    "* Visualizes each amino acid in a Pandas DataFrame with highlighted functional groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Student Challenge\n",
    "There are several issues with the current code. Your task is to diagnose and fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every amino acid contains a *backbone* carboxylic acid (–COOH) and amine (–NH₂) group attached to the α-carbon. These are part of the peptide backbone, they are *not* unique to any amino acid and disappear when amino acids are linked into peptides.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We are interested only in functional groups on the R group (the side chain attached to the α-carbon), since these are what distinguish amino acids chemically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Currently, the SMARTS patterns highlight all amine and carboxylic acid groups, including those in the backbone. Your goal is to modify the SMARTS logic so that it ignores the backbone and only highlights side-chain (R-group) functional groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Examine the SMARTS dictionary used in the code below.\n",
    "   Using recursive SMARTS (`$()` syntax) and the logical NOT operator (`!`), define patterns that:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Exclude the carboxylic acid directly attached to the α-carbon (the backbone COOH), and\n",
    "   * Exclude the amine attached to the α-carbon (the backbone NH₂).\n",
    "\n",
    "   In other words, your updated SMARTS should:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Only highlight R-group amines for Lysine, Arginine, and Histidine, and\n",
    "   * Only highlight R-group carboxylic acids for Aspartic acid and Glutamic acid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test your patterns by altering the code so it works as specified\n",
    "   Which SMARTS patterns successfully exclude the backbone groups but still identify R-group functionalities?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bonus:\n",
    "   * Can you write one recursive SMARTS that identifies *only* the α-carbon and its immediate substituents? That is, programmatic context sensitive substructure matching that only matches a pattern when it is attached to a specific type of atom, (the alpha carbon of an amino acid)."
